			<li><b>1969</b> Jim Hensons vision of making a ground breaking educational televison broadcast. Now a house hold name, Sesame Street has become one of the greatest and most memorable shows ever with its heart filled lessons, lovable and unforgetable characters (Elmo, Cookie Monster, Ernie, Bert, Big Bird, and etc) , and child friendly humor that is safe for all kids and adults alike. This show has recieved 41 seasons, 41 years of televison production credability, and is still running nonstop to this day.</li>
			<li><b>1976</b> Jim Henson's greatest creation that has spawned numerous movies, comics, characters, songs and much more on to only five seasons and and a 30 minute time slot. With so much background history in its name just the word "Muppet" helps people know it stands on its own. Winning numerous awards and nominees it's no wonder it has become a favorite among the worldwide community.</li>
			<li><b>1978</b> During the pre-production of the Dark Crystal, Jim Henson wanted to put his puppetry skills and anyone elses artistic ability to better uses so he created a creature shop company which allowed all sorts of film producers to get the exact types of sets, fictional characters, and even effects into their movie. Examples: TMNT, Babe, Alf, Never Ending Story, Harry Potter, Stuart Little, Muppet movies, and many more.</li>
			<li><b>1979</b> Said to be one of the greatest movies ever, the Muppet Movie not only finally presented the famous puppets in their very first big screen movie, but it also marked as one of Jim's most important projects ever in his career of film making and puppetry. (You must see it to believe it). This movie is mostly remembered for its opening scene when kermit plays his banjo while sining "The Rainbow Connection".</li>
			<li><b>1982</b> One of Jim Hensons strangest yet intriguing ideas to ever hit the big screen. (closest resemblence would be half Lord of the Rings and half Disney's the Black Cauldren). This movie has been known to be Jim Henson's most detailed ever. (In 2010 a sequel to this movie is said to be made in honor of Henson's anniversary).</li>
			<li><b>1983</b> Jim Hensons idea of a more colorful and fun show for childern. Fraggle Rock is more or less of Jim Hensons version of the Smurfs, which came out in 1981. This show was heavily based around teaching kids to make friends among their own community with a crazy and innovative world to explore.</li>
			<li><b>1985</b> Sesame Street's first of two thearetical movies. Jim wanted this particular film to have an important message to teach childern the importance of not running away from your family and friends (meaning it's a road movie). This film was picked up by Warner Brothers and was directed by Ken Kwapis.</li>
			<li><b>1990</b> Jim Henson dies at the age of 53 after an unexpected series of flu symptoms and severe organ faliure at the the New York Hospital in New York, New York. His legacy isn't forgotten when his death ceremony is a worldwide commissioned musical with Jim Henson's most treasured songs and moments all being performed by famous actors, associates, family, and even the audience. This historic event was held in both the Cathedral Church of Saint John Divine New York and St.Paul's Cathedral in London.</li>
			<li><b>2004</b> Walt Disney Studios had been wanting to aquire Jim Henson's company for some time mainly because of how well Sesame Street and the Muppets were doing (there even was a point in time that Henson could buy out disney), However, several years after Jim's unexpected death, Disney finally strikes a deal for them to get the Muppets and the Bear in the Big Blue House franchises. Since then the Muppets have recieved their own section of Disney Land and their own disney studio to make more stuff.</a>

			<i class="fa fa-quote-left" style="font-size:24px"></i> I've always tried to present a positive view of the world in my work. It's so much easier to be negative and cynical and predict doom for the world than it is to try and figure out how to make things better. We have an obligation to do the latter.
